  <!-- Steps to create the dish -->
  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Cut steaks into about 3 or 4 smaller pieces so it's easier to fit
        into the marinade.
    </li>
    <li>Whisk orange juice/sour orange, lime juice, olive oil, garlic,
        salt, cumin, pepper, oregano, and cayenne pepper together in a 
        large bowl. Place steak in 1 at a time into the marinade to thoroughly
        coat them. Add sliced onions and toss with the meat.
    </li>
    <li>Transfer mixture and marinade to a resealable plastic bag. Squeeze out
        air, seal bad, and place into a dish. Refrigerate for at least 2-3 hours.
    </li>
    <li>Heat cast iron pan to high heat and place a small amount of butter.
        Place steaks on cast iron pan once hot and cook for 45 seconds on each side,
        or until steaks have a nice sear on the outside.
    </li>
    <li>Place steak into oven at 225-250 degrees until internal temperature 
        reaches 135 degrees for a medium cook. Let meat rest for about 10 minutes;
        the internal temperature will raise to about 145 degrees and will be ready
        to eat.
    </li>
  </ol>
